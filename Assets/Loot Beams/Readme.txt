About
Loot Beams is a combination of Line Renderer and Particle components.

Usage
Grab any Loot Beam prefab located in Loot Beams/Prefabs and then just drop to your scene.
PLEAST NOTE! Every Loot Beam has an attached Animator component, this means animator will control width of Line Renderers, if you want to customize Line Renderers just delete the Animator component or customize animations.
Scaling is not a simple thing as you can see. Basicly Loot Beams is oriented on standard unity 1/1/1 scaling *units. If you have some extraordinary scales, then you have to rework Line Renderers and Particles manually.

Compitability
Unity 2018 and later.
Shaders constructed via Amplify Shader Editor.
LWRP/HDRP is not supported by default, but you can fix it by ASE.
Loot Beams require no scripts.
